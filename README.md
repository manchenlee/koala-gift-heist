# Koala's Gift Heist 無尾熊禮物搶案  

**This game is available at [itch.io](https://mchenlee.itch.io/koala-gift-heist)**

You are a magnificent Koala, yet you suffer from a cruel fate: the curse of the Southern Hemisphere has forever denied you Santa's grace. Filled with indignation this Christmas Eve, you storm into Santa's domain, ready to heist every gift intended for the children.  
But the North rejects you. As if their instincts repel your southern blood, everything from the house corners to the deep snow is coming alive to stop you...  
  
How to Play  
- Movement: WASD or Arrow Keys.  
- Objective: Steal as many gifts as possible before they catch you!   

Enemies & Items  
- Beware of Snowballs: They'll sweep away the loot right under your nose!  
- Muscular Reindeer: They love indoor fitness. One wave of their arms, and gifts (or trees!) will rain down from their thick armpit hair.  
- Christmas Trees: These uptight traditionalists won't give you any room to breathe!  
- The Santa Hat: Equip this to disguise yourself as a "Spy Santa." For 5 seconds, the North will respect you, giving you a moment of peace.
